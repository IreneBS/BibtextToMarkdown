   abstract = {Automatic detection of early blight caused by Alternaria solani could promote a drastic reduction in the consumption of plant protection agents and the related production losses. A proximal sensing platform was constructed and calibrated for acquiring high resolution hyperspectral images in the field, and used to accurately map Alternaria lesions. High resolution canopy reflectance images were obtained for 32 potato plants that had been infected with A. solani and 32 healthy reference plants. Spectral classifiers like partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machines (SVM) based on PCA scores were tested to discriminate affected and non-affected pixels. Both spectral classifiers performed well at pixel level with accuracies above 0.92. The NIR region (750 nm) was identified as the most discriminative part of the spectrum for detecting the lesions. As the disease pressure is typically expressed as the number of lesions per area, the accuracy was also evaluated at this level. This indicated a considerable number of false detections at the edges of the leaves and the leaf axils. Therefore, a decision tree was designed based on expert knowledge about the shape of Alternaria lesions, and used to post-process the classified images. This reduced the number of false detections, increasing the precision from 0.17 to 0.22 at the expense of a reduction in recall from 0.88 to 0.84. This leaves considerable room for improvement in the classification accuracy at the object level. We learned that (1) few, broad wavelengths are sufficient and (2) spatial context is essential for the detection of lesions caused by Alternaria infection. The application of more powerful object classification techniques such as convolutional neural networks to enhance the model performance by efficiently encapsulating the spatial context in the classifier might further improve the detection performance. This could pave the way to UAV or tractor based Alternaria mapping.},

Data on canopy cover (CC) and canopy height (CH) and their temporal changes throughout the growing season can yield information about crop growth and performance. In the present study, sigmoid models were fitted to multi-temporal CC and CH data obtained using RGB imagery captured with a drone for a broad set of soybean genotypes. The Gompertz and Beta functions were used to fit CC and CH data, respectively. Overall, 90.4% fits for CC and 99.4% fits for CH reached an adjusted R2 &gt; 0.70, demonstrating good performance of the models chosen. Using these growth curves, parameters including maximum absolute growth rate, early vigor, maximum height, and senescence were calculated for a collection of soybean genotypes. This information was also used to estimate seed yield and maturity (R8 stage) (adjusted R2 = 0.51 and 0.82). Combinations of parameter values were tested to identify genotypes with interesting traits. An integrative approach of fitting a curve to a multi-temporal dataset resulted in biologically interpretable parameters that were informative for relevant traits.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Water potential explains water transport in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum (SPAC), and is gaining interest as connecting variable between ‘pedo-, bio- and atmosphere’. It is primarily used to simulate hydraulics in the SPAC, and is thus essential for studying drought effects. Recent implementations of hydraulics in large-scale Terrestrial Biosphere Models (TBMs) improved their performance under water-limited conditions, while hydraulic features of recent detailed Functional-Structural Plant Models (FSPMs) open new possibilities for dissecting complex traits for drought tolerance. These developments in models across scales deserve a critical appraisal to evaluate its potential for wider use in FSPMs, but also in crop systems models (CSMs), where hydraulics are currently still absent. After refreshing the physical basis, we first address models where water potential is primarily used for describing water transport along the transpiration pathway from the soil to the leaves, through the roots, the xylem and the leaf mesophyll. Then, we highlight models for three ecophysiological processes, which have well-recognised links to water potential: phloem transport, stomatal conductance and organ growth. We identify water potential as the bridge between soil, root and shoot models, as the physiological variable integrating below- and above-ground abiotic drivers, but also as the link between water status and growth. Models making these connections enable identifying crucial traits for ecosystem resilience to drought and for breeding towards improved drought tolerance in crops. Including hydraulics often increases model complexity, and thus requires experimental data on soil and plant hydraulics. Nevertheless, modelling hydraulics is insightful at different scales (FSPMs, CSMs and TBMs).</p>},

Characteristics that are visually scored in the field include aesthetic beauty as well as tolerance to (a)biotic stresses, among others. This work proposes methodologies based on vegetation indices and canopy height data derived from visual imagery captured using an RGB (red, green, blue) camera embedded in a drone to rank and select genotypes. This approach relies on quantitative evaluation standards that exclude breeder bias and speed up data collection. A proof of concept for nursery plants was developed in two woody ornamentals: sweet box (Sarcococca Lindl.) and garden rose (Rosa L.). This work aimed to compare methodologies and to propose how drones (unmanned aerial vehicles, UAV) and high throughput field phenotyping (HTFP) can be used in a commercial plant selection program. Data was gathered in 2019 in three well-established breeding trials, two for sweet box and one for rose. Characteristics discussed include plant architecture traits such as plant height and shape in the sweet box and rose as well as floribundity, continuous flowering and disease resistance in roses. Correlations were calculated between on-ground measurements and UAV-derived methods, obtaining significant results. The advantages and disadvantages of the methodology and the approach for each of the traits are discussed.},

   abstract = {Soil compaction is one of the main limiting factors for sustainable agriculture. Efficient methods for detecting the distribution of soil compaction at a field scale are urgently needed in precision agriculture. We evaluated the possibility to detect soil compaction from measurements of apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) by using electromagnetic induction (EMI) and maize traits at a ~1 ha field parcel. The soil was Luvisol, and soil compaction-related properties, such as bulk density (BD), penetration resistance (PR), soil texture, soil salinity, soil moisture and maize traits, were measured at ten locations across the field based on ECa variability. In this site-specific study, no good correlation between soil compaction properties (i.e. BD and PR) and ECa was found but soil clay content was positively related to ECa in the sublayer (P = 0.08). The variation in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-derived maize canopy height was significantly negatively correlated with soil compaction and a negative relationship between dry above-ground biomass and BD and PR existed at 25–50 cm layer. In addition, ECa and UAV-derived maize canopy height was negatively correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients of −0.67 in the 0–25 cm layer) under the rather dry conditions prevailing during this study. Overall, as could be expected, detecting soil compaction with ECa was challenging under heterogeneous terrains, while maize traits had a better correlation with spatial variability of soil compaction. Owing to its sensitivity to the integral variation of multiple soil properties, ECa was a good indicator of maize canopy height.},

This study advanced the current approach to species-level weed identification during the early growth stage by integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) imagery with standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models such as VGG16, Resnet152 and Inception-Resnet-v2. For this, a robust dataset was created with 33,467 labels of weeds (Atriplex patula, Chenopodium album, Convolvulus arvensis, Cyperus rotundus, Lolium rigidum, Portulaca oleracea, Salsola kali, Solanum nigrum) and crops (maize, tomato), which was subjected to different training, validation and test scenarios. Model inputs were adjusted in order to align them with the information represented by the UAV images. Initially, models were developed in balanced scenarios, gradually increasing label numbers to assess their performance. Inception-ResNet-v2 achieved over 90% accuracy with 400 labels, while ResNet152 and VGG16 required 600 and 800 labels, respectively, for similar accuracy. In a more complex and realistic scenarios with unbalanced datasets, Inception-ResNet-v2 outperformed, likely due to its deeper architecture and enhanced capability to capture intricate features and patterns within UAV images. The study emphasized the importance of the minority-to-majority species ratio in unbalanced datasets, which affects minority species classification. To prevent misclassification, it is crucial to determine the right number of labels for CNN model training and validation. Weed maps were generated after species classification using the Faster R–CNN algorithm as an object detector. This advancement in methodology facilitates the precise and efficient implementation of SSWM techniques.},

   abstract = {Precise irrigation management requires accurate knowledge of crop water demand to adequately optimize water use efficiency, especially relevant in arid and semi-arid regions. While unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAV) have shown great promise to improve the water management for crops such as vineyards, there still remains large uncertainties to accurately quantify vegetation water requirements, especially through physically-based methods. Notably, thermal remote sensing has been shown to be a promising tool to evaluate water stress at different scales, most commonly through the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). This work aimed to evaluate the potential of a UAV payload to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) and alternative ET-based crop water stress indices to better monitor and detect irrigation requirements in vineyards. As a case study, three irrigation treatments within a vineyard were implemented to impose weekly crop coefficient (Kc) of 0.2 (extreme deficit irrigation), 0.4 (typical deficit irrigation) and 0.8 (over-irrigated) of reference ET. Both the original Priestley-Taylor initialized two-source energy balance model (TSEB-PT) and the dual temperature TSEB (TSEB-2T), which takes advantage of high-resolution imagery to discriminate canopy and soil temperatures, were implemented to estimate ET. In a first step, both ET models were evaluated at the footprint level using an eddy covariance (EC) tower, with modelled fluxes comparing well against the EC measurements. Secondly, in-situ physiological measurements at vine level, such as stomatal conductance (gst), leaf (Ψleaf) and stem (Ψstem) water potential, were collected simultaneously to UAV overpasses as plant proxies of water stress. Different variants of the CWSI and alternative metrics that take advantage of the partitioned ET from TSEB, such as Crop Transpiration Stress Index (CTSI) and the Crop Stomatal Stress Index (CSSI), were also evaluated to test their statistical relationship against these in-situ physiological indicators using the Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ). Both TSEB-PT and TSEB-2T CWSI related similarly to in-situ measurements (Ψleaf: ρ ~ 0.4; Ψstem: ρ ~ 0.55). On the other hand, stress indicators using canopy fluxes (i.e. CTSI and CSSI) were much more effective when using TSEB-2 T (Ψleaf: ρ = 0.45; Ψstem: ρ = 0.62) compared to TSEB-PT (Ψleaf: ρ = 0.18; Ψstem: ρ = 0.49), revealing important differences in the ET partitioning between model variants. These results demonstrate the utility of physically-based models to estimate ET and partitioned canopy fluxes, which can enhance the detection of vine water stress and quantitatively assess vine water demand to better manage irrigation practices.},

In this study, we addressed the detection and classification of weeds in maize and tomato in their early growth stages by integrating images acquired from UAVs and analysis based on advanced convolutional neural networks. Subsequently, the objective of this research was the creation of geo-referenced maps that would allow localized and selective post-emergence management of weed species. Our results indicate that the combination of UAV-captured imagery and deep learning algorithm-based image analysis provides an effective solution for this purpose. The accuracy and efficiency achieved in the identification of weeds in their early stage were promising, both in the set of species present in the crop and in individual species. This advance is of great relevance in the field of PA, as it would allow a more efficient management of weeds by selecting the herbicide according to the type of weed present, reducing the use of herbicides and ultimately contributing to the sustainability and profitability of agriculture. In addition, the generation of geo-referenced maps facilitates real-time decision making. In summary, this study suggests that the combination of emerging technologies, such as drones and deep neural networks, may be applicable tools in localized weed management in the context of PA.},

Our results showed that resampling accurately extracted the spectral values from high spatial resolution UAV-images at an altitude of 30 m and the RS-image data at altitudes of 60 and 100 m, was able to provide accurate weed cover and herbicide application maps compared with UAV-images from real flights.},

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry is a quick and affordable method for information collecting; it provides spectral and spatial information when required with the added value of Digital Surface Models (DSMs) that reconstruct the crop structure in 3D using ``structure from motion'' techniques. In the full process from UAV flights to image analysis, DSM generation is one bottle-neck due to its high processing time. Despite its importance, the optimization of the required forward overlap for saving time in DSM generation has not yet been studied. UAV images were acquired at 50 and 100 m flight altitudes over two olive orchards with the aim of generating DSMs representing the tree crowns. Several DSMs created with different forward laps (in intervals of 5--6\{%\} from 58 to 97\{%\}) were evaluated in order to determine the optimal generation time according to the accuracy of tree crown measurements computed from each DSM. Based on our results, flying at 100 m altitude and with a 95\{%\} forward lap reported the best configuration. From the analysis derived from this configuration, tree volume was estimated with 95\{%\} accuracy. In addition, computing time was 85\{%\} lower in comparison to the maximum overlap studied (97\{%\}). It allowed computing the 3D features of 600 trees in a 3-ha parcel in a highly accurate and quick (a few hours after the UAV flights) manner by using a standard computer.},

The combination of wireless sensors and raspberry pi through web server and fertilizer sprayer is proposed to support the smart agriculture. The sensors are connected to web server via raspberry pi controls the field activity. The sensors senses each activity happening in the field and upload in web server. The farmer will come to know about the field scenario through messages and can smartly do watering and spraying fertilizer to the field in very efficient manner without overdoing it and quality of the crops is saved.},

   abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with different spectral range
sensors are an emerging technology for providing early weed maps for
optimizing herbicide applications. Considering that weeds, at very early
phenological stages, are similar spectrally and in appearance, three
major components are relevant: spatial resolution, type of sensor and
classification algorithm. Resampling is a technique to create a new
version of an image with a different width and/or height in pixels, and
it has been used in satellite imagery with different spatial and
temporal resolutions. In this paper, the efficiency of resampled-images
(RS-images) created from real UAV-images (UAV-images; the UAVs were
equipped with two types of sensors, i.e., visible and visible plus
near-infrared spectra) captured at different altitudes is examined to
test the quality of the RS-image output. The performance of the
object-based-image-analysis (OBIA) implemented for the early weed
mapping using different weed thresholds was also evaluated. Our results
showed that resampling accurately extracted the spectral values from
high spatial resolution UAV-images at an altitude of 30 m and the
RS-image data at altitudes of 60 and 100 m, was able to provide accurate
weed cover and herbicide application maps compared with UAV-images from
real flights.},

   abstract = {This article describes the technical specifications and configuration of
a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to acquire remote images
using a six-band multispectral sensor. Several flight missions were
programmed as follows: three flight altitudes (60, 80 and 100 m), two
flight modes (stop and cruising modes) and two ground control point
(GCP) settings were considered to analyze the influence of these
parameters on the spatial resolution and spectral discrimination of
multispectral orthomosaicked images obtained using Pix4Dmapper.
Moreover, it is also necessary to consider the area to be covered or the
flight duration according to any flight mission programmed. The effect
of the combination of all these parameters on the spatial resolution and
spectral discrimination of the orthomosaicks is presented. Spectral
discrimination has been evaluated for a specific agronomical purpose: to
use the UAV remote images for the detection of bare soil and vegetation
(crop and weeds) for in-season site-specific weed management. These
results show that a balance between spatial resolution and spectral
discrimination is needed to optimize the mission planning and image
processing to achieve every agronomic objective. In this way, users do
not have to sacrifice flying at low altitudes to cover the whole area of
interest completely.},

   abstract = {Drought causes significant damage to a high value crop of soybean. Europe has an increasing demand for soybean and its own production is insufficient. Selection and breeding of cultivars adapted to European growth conditions is therefore urgently needed. These new cultivars must have a shorter growing cycle (specifically for adaptation to North-West Europe), high yield potential under European growing conditions, and sufficient drought resistance. We have evaluated the performance of a diverse collection of 359 soybean accessions under drought stress using rain-out shelters for 2 years. The contrasting weather conditions between years and correspondingly the varying plant responses demonstrated that the consequences of drought for an individual accession can vary strongly depending on the characteristics (e.g., duration and intensity) of the drought period. Short duration drought stress, for a period of four to 7 weeks, caused an average reduction of 11% in maximum canopy height (CH), a reduction of 17% in seed number per plant (SN) and a reduction of 16% in seed weight per plant (SW). Long duration drought stress caused an average reduction of 29% in CH, a reduction of 38% in SN and a reduction of 43% in SW. Drought accelerated plant development and caused an earlier cessation of flowering and pod formation. This seemed to help some accessions to better protect the seed yield, under short duration drought stress. Drought resistance for yield-related traits was associated with the maintenance of growth under long duration drought stress. The collection displayed a broad range of variation for canopy wilting and leaf senescence but a very narrow range of variation for crop water stress index (CWSI; derived from canopy temperature data). To the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting a detailed investigation of the response to drought within a diverse soybean collection relevant for breeding in Europe.},

   abstract = {Red clover (Trifolium pratense) is a protein-rich, short-lived perennial forage crop that can achieve high yields, but suffers increasingly from drought in different cultivation areas. Breeding for increased adaptation to drought is becoming essential, but at this stage it is unclear which traits breeders should target to phenotype responses to drought that allow them to identify the most promising red clover genotypes. In this study, we assessed how prolonged periods of drought affected plant growth in field conditions, and which traits could be used to distinguish better adapted plant material. A diverse panel of 395 red clover accessions was evaluated during two growing seasons. We simulated 6-to-8-week drought periods during two consecutive summers, using mobile rain-out shelters, while an irrigated control field was established in an adjacent parcel. Plant growth was monitored throughout both growing seasons using multiple flights with a drone equipped with RGB and thermal sensors. At various observation moments throughout both growing seasons, we measured canopy cover (CC) and canopy height (CH). The crop water stress index (CWSI) was determined at two moments, during or shortly after the drought event. Manual and UAV-derived measurements for CH were well correlated, indicating that UAV-derived measurements can be reliably used in red clover. In both years, CC, CH and CWSI were affected by drought, with measurable growth reductions by the end of the drought periods, and during the recovery phase. We found that the end of the drought treatment and the recovery phase of approximately 20 days after drought were suitable periods to phenotype drought responses and to distinguish among genotypes. Multifactorial analysis of accession responses revealed interactions of the maturity type with drought responses, which suggests the presence of two independent strategies in red clover: ‘drought tolerance’ and ‘drought recovery’. We further found that a large proportion of the accessions able to perform well under well-watered conditions were also the ones that were less affected by drought. The results of this investigation are interpreted in view of the development of breeding for adaptation to drought in red clover.},

   abstract = {High resolution imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been established as an important source of information to perform precise irrigation practices, notably relevant for high value crops often present in semi-arid regions such as vineyards. Many studies have shown the utility of thermal infrared (TIR) sensors to estimate canopy temperature to inform on vine physiological status, while visible-near infrared (VNIR) imagery and 3D point clouds derived from red–green–blue (RGB) photogrammetry have also shown great promise to better monitor within-field canopy traits to support agronomic practices. Indeed, grapevines react to water stress through a series of physiological and growth responses, which may occur at different spatio-temporal scales. As such, this study aimed to evaluate the application of TIR, VNIR and RGB sensors onboard UAVs to track vine water stress over various phenological periods in an experimental vineyard imposed with three different irrigation regimes. A total of twelve UAV overpasses were performed in 2022 and 2023 where in situ physiological proxies, such as stomatal conductance (gs), leaf (Ψleaf) and stem (Ψstem) water potential, and canopy traits, such as LAI, were collected during each UAV overpass. Linear and non-linear models were trained and evaluated against in-situ measurements. Results revealed the importance of TIR variables to estimate physiological proxies (gs, Ψleaf, Ψstem) while VNIR and 3D variables were critical to estimate LAI. Both VNIR and 3D variables were largely uncorrelated to water stress proxies and demonstrated less importance in the trained empirical models. However, models using all three variable types (TIR, VNIR, 3D) were consistently the most effective to track water stress, highlighting the advantage of combining vine characteristics related to physiology, structure and growth to monitor vegetation water status throughout the vine growth period. This study highlights the utility of combining such UAV-based variables to establish empirical models that correlated well with field-level water stress proxies, demonstrating large potential to support agronomic practices or even to be ingested in physically-based models to estimate vine water demand and transpiration.},

   abstract = {Water stress is a critical factor affecting the health and productivity of ornamental plants, yet early detection remains challenging. This study aims to investigate the spectral responses of four ornamental plant taxa—Rosa hybrid (rose), Itea virginica (itea), Spiraea nipponica (spirea), and Weigela florida (weigela)—under varying levels of water stress using hyperspectral imaging and principal component analysis (PCA). Hyperspectral data were collected across multiple wavelengths and PCA was applied to identify key spectral bands associated with different stress levels. The analyses revealed that the first two principal components captured a majority of variance in the data, with specific wavelengths around 680 nm, 760 nm, and 810 nm playing a significant role in distinguishing between the stress levels. Score plots demonstrated clear separation between different stress treatments, indicating that spectral signatures evolve distinctly over time as water stress progresses. Influence plots identified observations with disproportionate impacts on the PCA model, ensuring the robustness of the analysis. Findings suggest that hyperspectral imaging, combined with PCA, is a powerful tool for early detection and monitoring of water stress in ornamental plants, providing a basis for improved water management practices in horticulture.},
